/**
 * DOCUMENTATION:
 * This is the main CSS file for the project. Instead of containing custom styles,
 * it now uses Tailwind CSS directives. During the development process (when you run `npm run dev`),
 * Vite processes this file and replaces these directives with the actual CSS needed
 * based on the class names it finds in your HTML and JavaScript files.
